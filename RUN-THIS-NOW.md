# ⚡ QUICK FIX - Run This Script Now!

## 🚨 SECURITY FIRST

Your API token was just shared. **After we fix your deployment, you MUST rotate this token!**

**Don't worry, I'll remind you at the end.** Let's fix your site first.

---

## 🚀 HOW TO USE THE FIX SCRIPT

### Step 1: Download the Script

The script is here: `fix-deployment.sh`

Make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x fix-deployment.sh
```

### Step 2: Find Your Account ID

Run this command:
```bash
./fix-deployment.sh find_account_id
```

You'll see something like:
```
Your Account Name - ID: abc123def456ghi789
```

**Copy that ID!**

### Step 3: Find Your Project Name

Edit the script and add your Account ID:
```bash
nano fix-deployment.sh
# or
vim fix-deployment.sh
```

Find this line and replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID_HERE`:
```bash
ACCOUNT_ID=abc123def456ghi789"  # <-- Paste your ID here
```

Save and run:
```bash
./fix-deployment.sh find_projects
```

You'll see:
```
Project: graysquaredstudios
```

**Copy that project name!**

### Step 4: Update Script with Project Name

Edit the script again and replace `YOUR_PROJECT_NAME_HERE`:
```bash
PROJECT_NAME="graysquaredstudios"  # <-- Paste your project name
```

### Step 5: FIX IT!

Run:
```bash
./fix-deployment.sh fix
```

You'll see:
```
🔧 Fixing build configuration...
✅ Build configuration fixed!
🚀 Triggering new deployment...
✅ Deployment triggered successfully!
🎉 SUCCESS! Your deployment should complete in 30-60 seconds.
```

**Done!** ✅

## 🌐 Check Your Site

After 30-60 seconds, visit:
- **Temporary URL:** `https://graysquaredstudios.pages.dev` (or your project name)
- **Dashboard:** https://dash.cloudflare.com → Pages → Your Project

---

## 🔒 CRITICAL: Rotate Your Token NOW

**Your token was exposed. Please rotate it immediately:**

1. **Go to:** https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens
2. **Find your token** (ends in ...xJoc)
3. **Click "Roll"** to generate a new token
4. **Copy the new token**
5. **Update any scripts/tools** that use the old token
6. **Delete** the `CLOUDFLARE_TOKEN.txt` file

**Why?** Anyone with this token can access your Cloudflare account. Always keep API tokens secret!

---

## 💡 Alternative: Manual Dashboard Fix (If Script Doesn't Work)

If the script has issues, you can fix it manually:

1. Go to: https://dash.cloudflare.com
2. Click **Pages** → Your Project → **Settings**
3. Find **"Build & deployments"**
4. Click **"Edit configuration"**
5. **Clear the build command** (delete all that tutorial text)
6. **Set Build output:** `/`
7. **Save** and **Retry deployment**

---

## ✅ After Your Site Is Live

1. ✅ Fix contact form (see: CONTACT-FORM-FIX-GUIDE.md)
2. ✅ Connect custom domain: graysquaredstudios.com
3. ✅ Test everything works
4. ✅ Start getting clients! (see: START-TODAY-Action-Checklist.md)

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: jq"
Install jq (for pretty JSON formatting):
```bash
# Mac:
brew install jq

# Ubuntu/Debian:
sudo apt-get install jq

# Or run commands without jq - they'll still work
```

### "Authentication required"
- Check your API token is correct
- Make sure you copied it exactly (no spaces)
- Verify the token has correct permissions

### "Project not found"
- Check your project name is spelled correctly (case-sensitive!)
- Verify you're using the right account ID
- Use `find_projects` command to see exact name

## 📞 What Happens Next

Once deployment succeeds:

1. **Your site is live** at the temporary URL
2. **Connect your domain** (graysquaredstudios.com)
3. **Fix contact form** with FormSpree
4. **Start promoting** your site!

You're literally **minutes away** from having a fully functional business website! 🚀

# 1. Make script executable
